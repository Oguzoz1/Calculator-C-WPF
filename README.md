# Caltulator-C-WPF
A simple calculator missing few functions designed with modern aesthetic understanding.

After creating a new WPF project, xaml codes can be replaced/submitted to XAML area. This will provide you the design. Afterwards, by clicking any button, open the MainWindow.xaml.cs. Possibly the name can be different. You are supposed to open a new .cs file that contains interaction which can be achieved through clicking any button that is existing in design panel.
MainWindow.xaml.cs file can be used and replaced there which will provide enough statements to run the calculator.
